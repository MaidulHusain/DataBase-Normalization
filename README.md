# Introduction
As a data base deveolper we normalize and denormalize database to organize a given database efficiently. Generally, it is a systematic approch to decompose a larger dataset into smaller ones that would help us in get rid of data redundancy. 

According to wikipidea 
"Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model."

# DataBase-Normalization
The following database rules are widely used for noramalization 
- First Normal Form
- Second Normal Form
- Third Normal Form
- Fourth Normal Form 
- Fifth Normal Form
- Sixth Normal Form 
# Objective:
In this project we will focus on the first three normalizing process in database, and other forms are out of the scope of this projects.
